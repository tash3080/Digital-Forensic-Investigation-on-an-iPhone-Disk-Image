# Digital-Forensic-Investigation-on-an-iPhone-Disk-Image

In this project, I assumed the role of a forensic investigator tasked with examining a case that involves the theft of valuable stamps and defacing of museums at the National Gallery, Washington D.C. I conducted the digital forensic investigation on an iPhone disk image of a suspect named Tracy. I used used Autopsy, an open-source forensic tool, which was installed on a Kali Linux VM for this investigation. I was able to find out the offenders successfully through this investigation and then prepared the report on the case.
